# Template Summary

## What This Template Is

This is a **generic AI agent evaluation framework** derived from a specific project implementation. It has been cleaned and generalized to serve as a template for evaluating AI coding agents on any codebase.

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Created

Created comprehensive documentation to guide usage and customization:

- **README.md** - Complete architectural overview and framework explanation
- **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step guide for setting up and using the framework
- **CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed instructions for adapting to different projects
- **QUICKSTART.md** - 15-minute quick start guide
- **TEMPLATE_SUMMARY.md** - This file

### 2. Tasks Converted to Templates

Replaced all specific task implementations with generic templates:

- **basic_tasks.py** - Three example templates showing easy task structure
- **medium_tasks.py** - Three example templates showing medium task structure  
- **hard_tasks.py** - Three example templates showing hard task structure

Each template includes:
- Complete problem decorator syntax
- Detailed description structure
- Grading function implementation
- Comprehensive comments explaining each section
- Examples of different patterns (hints, multiple graders, etc.)

### 3. Code Generalized

Made the codebase more generic and configurable:

- **grading_runner.py**:
  - Changed hardcoded `/home/ubuntu/outline` to `os.environ.get("REPO_PATH", "/home/ubuntu/repo")`
  - Changed hardcoded database name to `os.environ.get("TEST_DB_NAME", "test_db")`
  - Added import for `os` module
  - Made paths configurable via environment variables

- **pyproject.toml**:
  - Added `packaging>=21.0` dependency (was missing)

### 4. Maintained Core Functionality

Kept intact:
- All grading logic and infrastructure
- Test execution framework
- Grade composition system
- MCP server integration
- Tool implementations
- Utility functions
- Setup scripts

## What Was NOT Changed

The following components were intentionally left unchanged as they are framework infrastructure:

- **spec.py** - Core problem/grade/grader definitions
- **graders.py** - Grader implementations
- **app.py** - MCP server and main entry points
- **utils.py** - Utility functions
- **tools/** - All tool implementations
- **setup.py** - Environment setup
- **Dockerfile** - Container configuration (can be customized per CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md)
- **Docker support files** - Database initialization, service management

These files contain the framework logic and don't have project-specific content that needs removal.

## How to Use This Template

1. Adapt build process for your project
2. Configure your test framework
3. Update database setup (if needed)
4. Customize server management
5. Create project-specific documentation

### For Understanding the System

Read **README.md** for:
- Architecture overview

Task Templates:
└── src/hud_controller/extractors/
    ├── basic_tasks.py            # Easy difficulty templates
    ├── medium_tasks.py           # Medium difficulty templates

```

## Key Features

### 1. Test-Based Validation

Tasks are validated by:
- Applying test patches with failing tests
- Applying agent solution patches
- Running tests and parsing JUnit XML results
- Computing grades from test outcomes

### 2. Flexible Grading

Multiple grading strategies supported:
- Single test file (all-or-nothing)
- Multiple test files with weights
- Custom graders for special validation
- Composite grading with multiple components

### 3. Environment Isolation

Each grading run:
- Creates clean repository copy
- Applies patches in controlled order
- Runs in isolated workspace
- Cleans up after completion

### 4. Extensible Architecture

Easy to extend:
- Add new grader types
- Support new test frameworks
- Integrate new tools
- Customize workflow steps

## Configuration Points

The template is designed to be configured via:

### Environment Variables

```bash
REPO_PATH=/path/to/repo              # Target repository location
TEST_DB_NAME=test_db                 # Test database name
MCP_TESTING_MODE=1                   # Enable testing mode
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG                      # Logging verbosity
START_SERVER_FOR_TESTS=true          # Whether to start server
```

### Task Parameters
